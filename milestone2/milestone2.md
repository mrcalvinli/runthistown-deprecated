Milestone 2
===========


Questions
---------

1. Did any of your answers to Milestone 1 change (particularly the Additional Questions, your idea for your site, or team members)? Write the numbers for the questions whose answers have changed, and their new answers.

2. Which features are implemented. To what extent are they complete?
3. Are there any features you wanted to include in your MVP from Milestone 1 that are not complete? If so, which are they?
4. What additional features do you wish to implement? How far along on those features are you?
5. What technologies are you using for the back-end? Include any frameworks if relevant.
6. What technologies are you using for the front-end? Include Javascript frameworks such as jQuery, templating frameworks such as Handlebars.js, and other client-side frameworks such as Ember.js or Backbone.js.
7. What is the main browser you are targeting? Must be one of our supported browsers.
8. What implementation unknown / risks are you still facing? Consider this an exercise of imagination, not a test of confidence.


Answers

1. It seems that things pretty much went as we expected from milestone 1, and hence our answers remain the same.
2. We have a log-in and sign-out system, that stores user data on the back-end.  In addition, users can create routes, which are sent to the database and associated with that user.  The user can go to their profile and view the routes that are stored for their profile.  On the route planner page, custom and shortest path ordering is working for creating routes.  Auto ordering should be able to be done by the final submission, but is not guaranteed.  The route creator also has some minor bugs when creating routes that still need to be fixed, and we'd also like to account for more error tolerance as well, specifically on the route planner.
3. No, we met our expectations
4. We would like to include auto ordering on the route creator.  This is semi-intensive, and work has not started on it yet.  We'd like to add friending features, more profile editing features, a route search bar, and if possible, we'd like to scrape data from a website to give the user suggested places to visit in the city they're running.  We have not started work on any of these features either.  We're also looking to give the user stats to display on their profile, which we've somewhat started, and have an award system, which we have not started.  We realize many of these features will not be included in our final submission, but if the app is good enough to continue work on it, then we will still have many goals for it.
5. We're still using Ruby on Rails for our back-end.
6. For our front-end, we are using jQuery, Bootstrap, Google Maps API for our route planner, and glyphicons (provided by bootstrap).
7. All of us have been working on Chrome, so we are mainly targeting Google Chrome.
8. Some risks that are still present are the possibility that hosting on heroku could cause things to break, as we have already seen.  For our submission we will probably be giving you a URL to a server run on one of our computers because of this.
