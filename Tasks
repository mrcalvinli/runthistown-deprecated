Tasks

Tasks for Map page
	- Add delete to routeEntry
	- Draggable inputs
	- Add autocomplete to input fields in your route
	- Deleting feature (time intensive)
	- Clear all button

	- Error checking

	Things to fix:
		- Deleting after a path is created (either disable delete, or update path)
		- (minor) multiple markers placed down over time instead of just one
		- street view, and those controls on the side are trippin
		- when geometry not found, do not add marker

Tasks for backend
	- give functionality to navbar search bar (look through saved routes)
	- navbar "Sign Up" changes to User name if user is logged in, with user picture
